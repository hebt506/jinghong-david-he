                    The paired Living on the Water courses (ARTH1701 & EESC1702) pose Enduring Questions: 
                    Why do humans build cities on the water? How does the coast impact humans? How do humans 
                    impact the coast in intentional and inadvertent ways? Venice and Boston offer exemplary 
                    case studies, historically and presently, to think critically about these fundamental questions 
                    of human and natural history from the rich perspectives of geology and art history. Students study 
                    the natural processes that define coastlines; their impact on Venice’s history, politics, commerce, 
                    art, and architecture; the effect of development on the coastline; and the threat of rising sea level 
                    on the future existence of Venice and Boston. Students are introduced to new ways of thinking about a
                     sense of place and connections between the natural and built environments.
