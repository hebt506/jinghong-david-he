                    In this paper, we are going to analyze how the local governments of Qianxi and Xishui County in Guizhou should react 
                    when the price of rice noodles went up this October. For both counties, restaurants observed the increase of their 
                    input price and increased their price per serving, which had made public opinion exploded. 
                    The local authorities of both counties put a price ceiling to set the price back to the original level.
                    The result is a market failure caused by government intervention. This paper proposes to remedy this failure by 
                    implementing policies that would make residents value breakfast more and encouraging investment from restaurant chains.
