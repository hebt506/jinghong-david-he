                    This paper focuses on the effect physical look has on an individual’s hourly income. This
                    study employs data obtained from the BC dataset, bcbeauty, which contains consists of
                    representative samples of 1260 Americans and their appearance ratings. This data is used to
                    regress hourly income on different variables that can also influence an individual’s income, for
                    example, gender and years of education. These factors are used to adjust for the income
                    differentials related to looks. Results confirmed that physical attractiveness slightly correlates
                    positively with yearly income. And larger incomes are also associated with maleness and more education.
